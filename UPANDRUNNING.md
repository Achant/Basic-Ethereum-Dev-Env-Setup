### testrpc & Metamask
After installing testrpc, run the `testrpc` command in a bash shell.

Testrpc creates a local ethereum client for testing and development. It's your `localhost`.

Once Metamask is installed on chrome and you're logged into the app, click the `Ethereum Main Net` button in the upper left hand corner of the pop over & choose `localhost:8545`
